# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
I was given the tast from a Colorado Board of Elections employee to complete election audits of a recent local congressional election.

The tasks were the following:
1. calculate a complete list of candidates who received votes.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. calculate the percentge of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- software: python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election showed us that:
- There was 369,711 votes that were cast in the election.
- The candidates in the election were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The Candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who had 73.8% of the vote an 272,892 number of votes
## Challenge Overview
The idea of this challenge was to be able to take a csv file and see the data in the file and compile code that allowed the user to get the data they needed. I created code that allowed me to take the total amount of votes in the data as well as counted each vote for the candidates. Doing this allowed me to be able to calculate the popular vote and the winner of the election.

## Challenge Summary
This challenge showed me the flexibility of python and how I can use loops and if statments to filter the data I need and collect data I need from a different file. This challenge allowed me to be able to manuver data files and has given me the skills to create code for any data sets.
